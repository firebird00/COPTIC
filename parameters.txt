Explanation of COPTIC command line parameters.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-ni.... Set number of particles per node. Zero implies unset. Default 0.
If set non-zero, specifies the exact number of particles per processor
(node) n_part. So that the total number of particles is nproc x
n_part. Every time a particle leaves the domain, a new one is
injected.

--reinj.... Set the reinjection number for each step, per node, ninjcomp.
A complement of exactly ninjcomp particles per processor is injected
at each step.

-ri.... Set the rhoinfinity per node, and hence ninjcomp. Default 100.
The value of -ri is converted into ninjcomp by ninjcalc during
initialization. The total rhoinfinity is nproc times the value
specified. This is the equivalent of --reinj but more convenient.

-rx.... Set the potential relaxation rate per step, crelax. Default 1.
The edge potential phirein is used to set the factor chi, which
adjusts the reinjection rate by the OML factor, and averein which
increments the injection energy. However, the update of phirein is
multiplied at each step by crelax. So if crelax=1, the update is
immediate, while if crelax=0. the update is zero, and chi and averein
remain zero throughout.

-dt.... Set the timestep during the main part of the iteration. Default .1

-da.... Set the timestep acceleration factor during the first part of
 the time duration, bdt. Default 1. The timestep dt is multiplied by a
 factor max(1.,(bdt-1.)*(maccel-j+2)/(maccel+1.)+1.), where
 maccel=nsteps/3.  So the timestep ramps down linearly from bdt*dt to
 dt in the first 1/3 of the timesteps.

-ds.... Set the timestep subcycle-fraction, subcycle. Default 0.  
If non-zero, sets the maximum permissible momentum increment per step
arising from electric field. Divide the timestep by an integer, to
give a shorter step: dtc = dt/max(1, int(f*dt/subcycle)), where f is
the local acceleration of this particle.

-s....  Set the total number of steps to take. Default 5. 
If restarting, this is the number of _additional_ steps. 

-v....  Set the drift velocity, vd . Default 0.

-t....  Set the ion temperature, Ti (/T_e). Default 1.

-l....  Set the electron Debye length, debyelen. Default 1.

-a....  Set the averaging time, istepave. Default 100.
This controls the number of steps over which diagnostic and other
quantities are averaged.

-ct.... Set the collision time, colntime. Default 0 [off].

-vn.... Set the neutral drift velocity, vn. Default 0.

--objfile<filename> Set the name of the object file. Default ccpicgeom.dat

--restart Attempt to restart the code from a saved state.
