COPTIC   Cartesian-coordinate Oblique-boundary Particles and Thermals in Cell

This code is for computational simulation of flowing plasma interacting
with objects of various specifiable geometries. It is extensively documented
in the Reference Manual.

Quick-start: 
	     $ cd COPTIC
	     $ make

If that works you are up and running. The first time, some code tests
will be run in the background after the make process has finished.
If checksums don't match, an error will be reported. However, don't be
too alarmed if that happens, since different compilers might give 
different results.
