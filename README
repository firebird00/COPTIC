COPTIC   Cartesian-coordinate Oblique-boundary Particles and Thermals in Cell

This code is for computational simulation of flowing plasma interacting
with objects of various specifiable geometries. It is extensively documented
in the Reference Manual.

Quick-start: 
	     $ cd COPTIC
	     $ make

If that works you are up and running. 
More comprehensive tests can be run by:
             $ make geometry
